342375108,"Complexity collector parameters supplied from job matrix fails","Overview ---------------- There seems to be a problem with the job matrix parameters loading  which causes Click to report allegedly missing required parameter  even though it is indeed specified in the job matrix.  Disclaimer: the bug recreation steps should only be attempted after the #46 is merged  as it contains new collector interface.  Example --------------- Using the job matrix :   and perun command:    we get an error message:   although the binary parameter is clearly specified in the job matrix.  Bug source ------------------ Ive been able to trace the root of the issue but the fix might require some conceptual rework of the job matrix parameters loading and their application to the command.  The problem is that the matrix parameters are supplied to the command after the Click interface parameters are processed. Specifically  in the  file  the annotated function complexity serves as a Click interface. The interface has one required parameter without default value  that must be provided in order to proceed. However  if the parameters are supplied via the job matrix  the actual update of the parameters happens after the complexity function  specifically:   where a statement  is located (the statement applies the job matrix parameters). Thus  if we provide the binary parameter in the matrix  in is not available to the Click interface in the time of its processing and that causes the Click to report a missing required parameter.",46358797,"[(57416429, 0.85167736), (58920363, 0.850548), (54906871, 0.84759116), (58339751, 0.84751064), (58594956, 0.84626776), (56449833, 0.8460615), (56554988, 0.8443464), (56422246, 0.84400094), (56866274, 0.8434015), (59013002, 0.84283364)] "

451679863,"neurosky mobile 2 with raspberry pi and python 3 ","Ive never left a comment/ reported an issue... so forgive me if this is misplaced.  I have been trying to connect the neurosky mindwave mobile 2 with raspberry pi 3 via python3.  I finally got it working thanks to these examples  though I had a bit of issues that I wanted to share in case anyone is going through something similar.   My experience level in python and linux OS is very beginner. I typically just blindly follow directions first and then try to address issues as they come up.   1. when I originally found this example  I used the command in the terminal that pulls from the github repository. Unfortunately  this loaded an older version  not the current one. Not sure how I would have done the latest one. I noticed that the version I loaded was for python2 as the errors I received (and googled) pointed this issue out. I was getting this error: TypeError: Cant convert bytes object to str implicitly ... apparently thats a python 2 thing and python 3 has a different way of do it.   2. when I went to the actual github site (this one)  I noticed that the conversion from python2 to 3 had been made (oh  so sweet  thank you).  So  I copy pasted all the guts of each of these files ( MindwaveMobileRawReader  MindwaveDataPoints  MindwavePacketPayloadParser MindwaveDataPointReader) because I dont know to update it. Im not used to linux commands to know how to do it otherwise.   3. I did have issues being able to save / change code   so I made a new folder with all the python code and its allowing me to rewrite them now.  It wouldnt even let me change the permissions in the preferences for the original folder.   4. I connected my neurosky to the raspberry pi manually  but this actually caused an issue because the python code is also trying to connect. When I disconnected manually and then run the code  it reconnected fine.   5. I got these errors: SystemError: Parent module  not loaded  cannot perform relative import.  I went through the format of how some of these files are imported. I noticed in the read_mindwave_mobile it says from MindwaveDataPoints import RawDataPoint  but the error was about MindwaveMobileRawReader not being able to be imported. The file trying to import was in MindwaveDataPointReader and this one had a period before the words so it looked like from .MindwaveMobileRawReader import MindwaveMobileRawReader and when I deleted that period  it worked fine.  Again  Im not well versed in python or linux... not sure what the period means (Im assuming something about how to find that folder/file)  and so maybe where my files are may not be where they should be or how it was intended. Currently  all my mindwave python files are in the same folder. Im using Thonny python IDE as it comes with the image for raspPi that I downloaded from the raspberry site 5/28/2019.  (edit: I removed all the periods from all the files that had them  then it worked)  thanks s   ",7279810,"[(57532341, 0.9162938), (52566503, 0.9043842), (56917315, 0.9026701), (57232897, 0.9021335), (57866601, 0.9018007), (57395705, 0.90044147), (30353823, 0.89814585), (34134224, 0.897924), (58237216, 0.89746135), (57729122, 0.8962164)] "

For example  setting the cut-off at 50% returns putative pseudogenes whose length is not only less than 50% the average length of blast hits  but also some ORFs that are higher than 50% of the average length. Not sure if this is a bug  or intentional given the arbitrary nature of this parameter to predict pseudogenes.  2) Looking at the length distribution of top blast hits  even among the 15 top hits  there are often outliers that may skew the average length of blast hit. For example  sometimes there are 14 hits that are around 300 residues long  and one that is only 70 residues. This short blast hit may derive from a metagenome (metagenomes often have partial gene fragments)  an amplicon  or another pseudogene from a related endosymbiont? Nonetheless  I am not sure if it is appropriate to keep it in for determination of average length of blast hits. Do you have a way of filtering out these outliers?  Thanks!

24673308,"profile auto-completion","By @JulianEberius The main changes I made to Rope concern auto-completion. It is very  very slow on large code bases (just try Rope s completions on Rope s code itself).  I used Python s profile module to track where the time is spent on a single completion request  and it was mainly file system related stuff that is called a lot of times for a single request. I added a lot of caching to my branch of Rope  but I didn t fully check whether I introduced subtle bugs or changed semantics this way. It improved latency by several orders of magnitude  which was important as Sublime Text does  as-you-type  autocompletion  so the operation needs to be performed in milliseconds (on almost every keystroke) even on large code bases.  Please see my commit on SublimePythonIDE for details  if you re interested on tackling this problem (https://github.com/JulianEberius/SublimePythonIDE/commit/85c490cd64). Sadly the commit intermingles the caching with a second  minor  issue: case-insensitive completions. Some people prefer to just type  and not to worry about lower/upper case if the completion engine can return the right thing anyway. As I said  this is minor  compared to the performance issues.  To tackle the problems systematically  it s probably best if you to some profiling of your own  I just used cProfile and gprof2dot to make graphs  If the completion performance is improved I would love to just add Rope as a submodule  instead of maintaining my own fork.

87219752,"Request: Adding in numpy.random.RandomState parameter into all randomized methods","One problem with using straight up  is there is a single global variable that handle all of the randomization calls.  If we wanted to parallel random sampling  this would quickly become a bottleneck. Right now  if I wanted to use  to perform multiple rarefaction on a boat load of samples  I cannot fork off multiple processes to get this job done in parallel and get different random samples - many of the processes will end up with the same random seed.  Take a look at this gist  Using  resolves this problem since it modularizes this functionality into separate objects.  This will allow for multiple independent streams to be created - making it possible to parallelize random sampling.

Particular things that I find helpful when reading code (and for avoiding circular imports) are to put all imports at the top of each module  and use a 99-character limit in lines of code and a 72-character limit in docstrings.  - I try to avoid defining functions within other functions.  There are some nifty things (dependency injection) one can do with functions in functions  but so far Ive only used classes to get this kind of behavior.   - I virtually always use single quotes for strings.  The only exception is when I have quotes within quotes.  - I avoid using   essentially always.  There is the industry standard   which are fine (but I actually avoid too)  but I would restrict  usage to cases where the name of the relevant package has changed between python 2 and 3.  Otherwise  renaming an imported package limits the readability across and within packages.  - I prefer having a complete argument list for functions  i.e.  I avoid using args and *kwargs when defining functions.  Having an upfront list of the objects passed to the function helps (at least me) to understand what a function does.  However  this gets broken when using globals...  - I avoid using globals almost at all costs.  There are some good reasons to have them  like for instantiating a single  package-level logger.  But I generally prefer to pass objects between functions instead of having them globally defined.  This approach leads to better clarity in terms of where each object is defined and how it is altered throughout the code.  For pypit  the big offender here (to my mind) is the  object.  Im planning to move this to   just like Ive done with   but Id also like to limit how  is used.  E.g.  if only a single value from  is used by a given function  I think we should be passing that value as a function parameter instead of having the function use  directly.

537261224,"Refactor controller file","@alexhanna I think I might need your input here.  I think issue #15 should be solved by putting in the ordered_load function from https://stackoverflow.com/a/21912744.  The question is where to put it.  AFAICT at the moment the controller is structured like this:  1. Module imports 1. Application and login manager creation 1. Definitions of (global?) variables (v2  yes_no_vars  meta_solr  etc.) 1. Helper functions (including some with and some without  decorators) 1. App setup functions 1. Coding pages functions 1.  class (many of whose methods have a  decorator) 1.  function 1.  function 1. A variable definition () 1.  function 1. Coder stats functions 1. Internal calls functions 1. Admin tools functions 1. if name == main  I think itd be nice to tidy that up a bit in general  but in particular at the moment this structure is making it hard to use functions when defining variables.  Variables defined from YAML files are currently in section 3  but at that point none of the functions have been read in  so if I want to use the ordered_dict function to get a yaml file into a variable  I either have to shoehorn it in before the variable definitions (where no other functions live)  or move the variable definitions after the functions.  My natural inclination is to put all the functions first and all executed code afterward  but it seems that the  and  decorators depend on  and  being set above the decorated function calls.  So I guess to follow my inclination would mean defining app and lm  then all the functions  and then the rest of the variables  which seems ungainly and error-prone.  Other solutions I can think of would be to move undecorated helper functions up (which also seems weird because then the variable definitions are in the middle)  to move only the helper functions to a separate file and import them  to move lots of stuff (everything?) to separate files and import it  or to do some clever thing so we dont have to define a bunch of what I think are global variables (which make me a little nervous?) in sections 3 and 10.  I assume all this is a good candidate for upstream since its ultimately just refactoring (although I assume wed want the ability to fix yaml list order in upstream as well  which depends on this)  and since this is partly a matter of code style  and since itd move a lot of stuff around  I wanted to see what you reckoned is best?",14415500,"[(56992826, 0.9229458), (4693120, 0.9187244), (1024049, 0.9181278), (22830923, 0.9141078), (58062432, 0.9136347), (56611213, 0.9092146), (57293994, 0.9091372), (56993673, 0.9052792), (58584171, 0.9050998), (58314695, 0.90483767)] "

Link to the code line: https://github.com/rainerf/ricodebug/blob/master/src/helpers/ptyhandler.py#L33  Use cases for super from the python 2.7 Documentation (http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=super#super)  > There are two typical use cases for super. In a class hierarchy with single inheritance  super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly  thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. >  > The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement  diamond diagrams  where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that this method have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime  because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy  and because that order can include sibling classes hat are unknown prior to runtime).

554724364,"Discussion: make Dataset an abstract class ?","about frontends development in general: the Dataset class  as it stands  is an abstract class as some of its code relies on unimplemented methods. When we wrote the AMRVAC frontend with @n-claes  especially as we were getting started  it was quite confusing how there wasnt a really explicit edge between what has to be there for the child class  to work  and what can be left unimplemented (at least a first). Taking inspiration from existing frontends also adds to the confusion in some ways  because most frontends will add code-specific methods  so as a newcomer you have to jump from one to the other in order to grasp which is which.  I was thinking that it could help future contributors to make Dataset an actual abstract class by inheriting from  .

Given a matrix  the function would identify a set of  independent rows/columns  where  is the rank of the matrix. An example use case is to remove redundant rows from a linear system to reveal a smaller but equivalent linear system.  - Id suggest a single function in  (unless there is a more appropriate home)  - A  argument would expose algorithms based on SVD  interpolative decomposition  and a pivot-based algorithm. Default   alternatives  and .  - The function would return a logical array in which ones corresponding with the independent rows. Its a one-liner from this to the use cases I can think of. - Optionally  the user can pass in the matrix rank  to save a bit of time. For some methods this would allow the algorithm to terminate early  for others it obviates the need to call  at the outset. - Optionally  the user can pass in the right hand side  of a linear system. Along with identifying independent rows  the routine can identify whether there are RHS values that make the system inconsistent.  Possible signature:   Questions:  - What are the use cases? Is this functionality worth exposing? - Should the function work on rows or columns by default? - Should there be an option for controlling whether the function looks for rows vs columns  or should the user just transpose the input? - Is there a need to return the linear combination of independent rows that produces the dependent rows?

564833696,"Prototoype for Datasette on PostgreSQL","I thought this would never happen  but now that Im deep in the weeds of running SQLite in production for Datasette Cloud Im starting to reconsider my policy of only supporting SQLite.  Some of the factors making me think PostgreSQL support could be worth the effort: - Serverless. Im getting increasingly excited about writable-database use-cases for Datasette. If it could talk to PostgreSQL then users could easily deploy it on Heroku or other serverless providers that can talk to a managed RDS-style PostgreSQL. - Existing databases. Plenty of organizations have PostgreSQL databases. They can export to SQLite using db-to-sqlite but thats a pretty big barrier to getting started - being able to run  and start trying it out would be a massively better experience. - Data size. I keep running into use-cases where I want to run Datasette against many GBs of data. SQLite can do this but PostgreSQL is much more optimized for large data  especially given the existence of tools like Citus. - Marketing. Convincing people to trust their data to SQLite is potentially a big barrier to adoption. Even if Ive convinced myself its trustworthy I still have to convince everyone else. - It might not be that hard? If this required a ground-up rewrite it wouldnt be worth the effort  but I have a hunch that it may not be too hard - most of the SQL in Datasette should work on both databases since its almost all portable SELECT statements. If Datasette did DML this would be a lot harder  but it doesnt. - Plugins! This feels like a natural surface for a plugin - at which point people could add MySQL support and suchlike in the future.

After this she would execute following commands to download and install the mod:    It would be also nice  if the mod allowed specifying the scripts directory for  game command (so that the user doesnt need to deal with a hidden folder deep under). This could be done either from the mod Config view in Minecraft (which currently crashes the game (1.12))  or by:    (BTW  does  command currently allow anything else beside running a script in certain directory?)

I am trying to figure out how to prepare Google OAuth2 authentication where there are two applications (frontend & backend) with the former initiating the process and the latter handling the actual authentication.  I have tried multiple approaches but none of them worked:  # Approach 1  There is an endpoint  that is an instance of :   The frontend starts the authentication by opening a popup with url:  and following query parameters:   Google redirects to  but the response is HTTP 405:   Unfortunately  there are a few problems with that: * GET is not supported in the view - it probably should be supported as HTTPS hides query params... * Response comes within  not query params  so presumably implicit flow is not the right one  # Approach 2  Lets use Authorization Code Grant flow.  The frontend starts the authentication by opening a popup with url:  and following query parameters:   I have adjusted the  view to match the documentation in library code:   Again  this leads to GET method not allowed...  # Approach 3 Lets add some code to handle GET requests the way POSTs are handled:    This  in turn  leads to an error:  Let me add  that obviously Ive triple-checked callback URLs in Google Developers Console.

While this looks very promising  it has one problem: it cant effectively handle the switch from JIT-ed code into not-jit-ed.

For example  you cant call functions from python standard packages... one exclusion is numpy: Numba is especially aware of numpy and works effectively with numpy calls.  So.

For the remaining part  I think I have completed the porting by making proper calls to PySide2 and Python3. Moreover  I also made several changes. Some of these are:  - brightness-reset now relies on utility - brightness-controller.svg was moved under ui  and is referenced in the code base as such. @apandada1 - you might have to change the build script for PPA slightly to handle that. Let me know if I can make this easier for you somehow. The SVG is referenced in two specific places in the code base as far as I remember. - The minimize to tray part was also modified. Now it will check if it is possible to be minimized to tray. If possible  closing minimizes it to tray and quitting from tray asks for confirmation. If not possible  the user is asked for confirmation directly.

When I import freetype in my python code  the system said:  raise RuntimeError(Freetype library not found) RuntimeError: Freetype library not found   Then  I deleted the freetype-py 0.5.1  and used pip to install freetype-py 1.0.

291664568,"message view: EXIF orientation is ignored  causing images to look rotated","(@gnprice:) Heres a nice description of the issue from a different webapp  complete with instructions for how to fix it as a user:  * The cause:    > You may notice that sometimes when [posting a photo on Zulip] that the image is not rotated correctly. This is not a bug [in Zulip]! Rather  this is a fairly technical behind-the-scenes issue that involves the photos orientation meta data and a web browsers inability to interpret it. [...]    > Cameras  especially those on mobile phones and tablets  have built-in orientation sensors that assign special rotation information to every photo they take. Behind the scenes  this tells other apps what the correct rotation angle should be for that photo. In other words  your photos are actually taken and saved sideways but then extra orientation meta data specifies a rotation angle for correctly displaying the photo. When you view that photo in your phones gallery  or in an app that understands the orientation meta data  it appears as if the image is rotated properly when its actually not. Unfortunately  web browsers [dont] honor orientation meta data. This is why a photo might appear sideways after it has been uploaded [to Zulip].    Sad but true. Some phones prevent this problem by rotating the actual image data  but many (even many recent  high-end phones) do not.  * How to fix it for your photos:    > To make sure that a photo will be displayed properly in web browsers the best option is re-save the photo with proper rotation and without orientation meta data. On a mobile device  you can often achieve this by opening a photo and rotating it 360 degrees or until it appears correctly then re-saving it as a new photo. Alternatively  you could save a slightly cropped version of the same photo. You could also download the photo onto a desktop computer and adjust it using the basic photo apps built into OSX and Windows (both called Photos) or an advanced photo editing program such as Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.  We should also develop a solution that fixes photos up automatically  so people dont have to do it themselves. More on that below.  --- (@gnprices technical description  following the investigation below:)  By default in a JPEG photo  the pixels around coordinates (0  0) -- i.e.  the first pixels in the file -- go in the upper left. Many devices produce JPEG files that start somewhere else. These contain some metadata  in the EXIF format  to say something like   meaning the pixel at (0  0) goes in the upper right instead of the upper left. This means any software displaying the photo needs to respect that metadata  if it doesnt  the photo will come out wrong  e.g. rotated sideways.  Unfortunately  while a lot of software does respect EXIF orientation metadata  the web does not. Specifically  an  element in HTML ignores it. The result  given we dont do anything to deal with this  is that these photos are shown sideways in the Zulip webapp  desktop app  and most of the mobile app.  Devices that produce photos with this problem include some phones  but not others  from each of Apple  Samsung  and Google  also some phones from Motorola and probably other vendors  probably some standalone digital cameras too  but nobody in these threads has tried one. Reports of this issue have referred to uploaded photos in messages and to user avatars.  To fix this  well need to inspect uploaded images (including user avatars) on the server at upload time to extract the EXIF orientation metadata. Then we can do either of the following: * Normalize the orientation to   rearranging the pixels as needed. (A Medium post linked below has example code to do this in Python  using PIL.) * Convey that metadata to the client (perhaps in a  attribute on the ?) so it can apply a CSS transform to fix the orientation.  For more detail and background  see https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8177#issuecomment-534310596 below  and the comments after it.  --- (original report:)  quoting a conversation:  A: my pictures come in sideways when i upload them  even when they are the correct orientation  B: If they are coming from a phone  this might be a matter of browser support. The image is rotated  but has metadata that specifis the correct orientation taken from the phones gyro. Browser not respecting this metadata might result in the issue.  C: I remember hearing about something crazy that iPhones specifically did here -- like if you go and rotate them in the built-in camera app  it just does something in some idiosyncratic metadata that Apples stuff all pays attention to.  D: Yeah this happens w iPhone metadata and browser uploads. Just detect the orientation by width vs height and make sure its not rotated.

 - [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe that this is not a duplicate.  ## Issue  The README states as the ideal way to install Poetry:    But  on an Ubuntu Xenial system with only Python 3 installed  this leads to the error . If I simply pipe the curl command through  instead then it succeds  but then I get:    This is because the top of the installed file at  contains .  If  instead  I install poetry with   then  shows  at the top of the file  which works perfectly.  Ubuntu  from 18.04 Xenial onwards  includes only Python 3 by default. And the minimal version of Xenial doesnt come with Python out of the box at all.  If you install Python 3 on Ubuntu  the binary thats installed is .  doesnt exist unless youve also installed Python 2. This deliberately follows PEP 394:  > - python2 will refer to some version of Python 2.x. > - python3 will refer to some version of Python 3.x. > - for the time being  all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2. > - however  end users should be aware that python refers to python3 on at least Arch Linux (that change is what prompted the creation of this PEP)  so python should be used in the shebang line only for scripts that are source compatible with both Python 2 and 3. > - in preparation for an eventual change in the default version of Python  Python 2 only scripts should either be updated to be source compatible with Python 3 or else to use python2 in the shebang line.  Although the PEP states python should be used in the shebang line only for scripts that are source compatible with both Python 2 and 3 Im not sure that this is compatible with the statement all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2  because this means that if a system doesnt have Python 2 then the  binary wont exist. I think scripts have to do their best to use  if they know its supported  and most Ive encountered do.

341052110,"ImportError in system pip wrappers after an upgrade","Overview After upgrading to pip 10 or higher  many users are encountering error like  *  *  *  *   These are caused by an incorrect attempt to upgrade pip  which has typically resulted in (parts of) multiple versions of pip being installed in the same Python installation  and those parts being incompatible.  It should be noted that these issues are invariably not problems with pip itself  but are due to incorrect use of pip  or unexpected interactions with system scripts that are not controlled by pip. So while well try to help you solve your issue  this is not the fault of pip  and you will have to be prepared to do at least some of the debugging and fixes on your own.  ## General Advice First  some general advice. It is assumed that anyone encountering issues will have failed to follow some part of this advice. Listing these items here is not intended to imply that its your fault and we wont help  but rather to help users to identify what went wrong  so that they can work out what to do next more easily.  1. Only ever use your system package manager to upgrade the system pip. The system installed pip is owned by the distribution  and if you dont use distribution-supplied tools to manage it  you will hit problems. Yes  we know pip says you should upgrade with pip install -U pip - thats true in a pip-managed installation  ideally distributions should patch this message to give appropriate instructions in the system pip  but they dont. Were working with them on this  but its not going to happen soon (remember  were looking at cases where people are upgrading old versions of pip here  so patches to new versions wont help). 2. Never use sudo with pip. This follows on from the first point. If you think you need to use sudo  youre probably trying to modify a distribution-owned file. See point 1. 3. Prefer to use . By doing this  you only ever install packages in your personal directories  and so you avoid interfering with the system copy of pip. But there are  issues you need to be aware of here. Well cover these later. Put simply  its possible to follow this advice  and still hit problems  because youre not actually running the wrapper you installed as .  ## Debugging the Issue Before trying to work out whats going on  its critically important that you understand precisely what scripts you are running and what versions of pip the relevant Python interpreter is using.  First  identify the full absolute path of the executable script that you are running. Thats often in the traceback you get  but if it isnt  you can use OS tools like   or Pythons  to identify the right script. Watch out for your shell confusing the issue  with aliases or potentially stale hashed commands.  Once you have identified the script  make sure you can reproduce the problem using the absolute path to that script. If you cant  you probably found the wrong script  so check again.  Second  work out which version of Python the script is using to run pip. Youll often be able to get that from the shebang line of the script. This can often be the trickiest problem  as wrapper scripts can take many forms depending on what tool created them. In the worst case  you can simply make an intelligent guess at this point.  Once you know which Python is running pip  you can run  to invoke pip. In most cases  this will work fine  as its the wrapper causing the issue  and not pip itself. Running pip via  in this way is often a perfectly acceptable workaround for the issue (at least in the short term).  Now run . This will give you the exact version and location of the installation of pip that your Python is seeing.  At this point  youre usually done - the fundamental cause of all these problems is running a wrapper script which is written expecting to see a version of pip older than pip 10 (thats why it imports ) under a Python interpreter that sees a copy of pip thats version 10 or later.  ## Fixing the Issue The problem  of course  is fixing the issue. And thats where you really are on your own. If you have changed your system installation  you really need to put it back the way that the distribution installed it. That may well require an uninstall and reinstall of your distributions pip package. Reinstalling is easy  of course - but uninstalling may require manually removing incorrect files. Or you may be able to force-reinstall with your distribution package manager  simply overwriting the incorrect files. Of course  this reverts you to the system-supplied version of pip. If you need a newer version  you should ask your distribution vendor  or use something like virtualenv to install it independently of your system packages.  It may be that youre simply running the wrong wrapper script. Maybe you did a  install of a new version of pip  but your PATH is set to run the system version of the wrapper rather than the user-local one installed with pip. In that case  you can simply fix your PATH. Thats usually the issue for people who do  and get the  error.  As already noted   is a reliable workaround  at the cost of using a more verbose command to invoke pip.  ## Community Advice The comments section of this issue is open for people to discuss specific problems  and to share potential solutions. Just to be clear  its quite likely with problems of this nature that youll need to modify system-supplied files or settings. You do so at your own risk. If youre not comfortable modifying your OS  or running as root  you should seek expert advice. To put it another way  if by following suggestions given here  you break your system  you get to keep the pieces. Theres only so much that can be achieved remotely.  Also  the pip developers dont provide any guarantees that advice in the comments on this issue is correct  or that it wont damage your system.

53281447,"relative links in toctree","Id like to use relative URLs in toctrees  but cant figure out how. It seems right now I have the choice between either internal links (where the target is another document)  or an (absolute) URL. The latter is identified by means of a sphinx.util.url_re.  Is there a way to have a toctree entry use a relative link  such that the generated html contains href=.../some/path.html ?

To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:   The error is    I thought of a potential way to fix this issue  which is to define a cleverhans  class and define the probabilities and the logits explicitly. However  this is also problematic because logits of an ensemble model is not defined  there are logits for each model that are being ensembled  but since the ensemble happens after each logit is softmaxed  theres no overall logit.  Expected behavior The attack should work regardless of whether the final layer is softmax or not  as the model is clearly differentiable and so methods like FGSM can be applied.

Reference: https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/uncategorized/radial-basis-function-network/ Please give suggestion on what should be standard approach to compute these weights?  2. I want to use LBFGS optimization technique for computing weights between hidden layer and output layer? How to do this using Keras library? Any inputs would be helpful. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS  Thanks.

237883000,"install procedure and python package creation is not aligned with pip and setuptools","The correct way to deal with the package dependencies is to use install_requires paramenter in setup.py setuptools.setup() call  and the correct way to deal with the setup script dependencies is to use setup_requires parameter. (see https://github.com/kytos/kytos/compare/master...erickvermot:new_setup_no_pip_call) But  this lead to the setup script being aborted because it is trying to modify files outside the build area (/etc files  etc...):    When reading about this  I have come to many conclusions that Id like to share here so we can discuss the installation process.   python packages were not meant for applications.  pip and setuptools do not expect things to be installed outside the package in arbitrary locations.  if we do want to distribute kytos as a python package  then all the logic regarding placing /etc/kytos files  and /var/lib/kytos files should be outside setup.py. Maybe done during the first time kytos is run  or simply checking for them every time and creating them if needed. (erasing /etc/kytos or /var/lib/kytos would not be a problem anymore) Obviously the logic about the pidfile in /var/run would have to change.  This way we can: - simply use setup_requires and install_requires to deal with dependencies  avoid calling pip from within setup (bad practice that may lead to serious problems) and let pip deal with the requirements in its own way. - make the correct use of requirements.txt. - not have to worry if setup.py is run in a VENV or not. - not have to worry about wheels problems that arise when placing files outside the package. - not have to worry about some other package putting kytos in its install_requirements. - allow kytos to be installed and run by a regular user.

I tried to use Jupyter as well and the same issue come up.  On Jupyter  using the getting-started file  I tried to add on the step 3  a parameter worker_id=2 as follow     The console changed the index on the string  but the same error occurred.   Using the terminal and adding  resulted in not having the --train command processed  as it looks like to be removed HERE  Again  using the terminal and adding (or any other number) returns the same error  where the initial console info showed a different base-port.  Not being an expert in python and socket communication  Im quite stuck and I do not know where to start to close a port  or any other possible fix.

[x] Im asking a question - [x] Ive looked through the README and FAQ for similar questions - [x] Ive searched the bugtracker for similar questions including closed ones  youtube-dl version 2019.11.28 is installed in both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 19.10. Both are installed directly from the download page (not using the Ubuntu package).  In Windows  most downloads default to hlsnative  for the few that dont I can set the  option and it works.  In Ubuntu  hlsnative never works  even with the option set. youtube-dl displays this message:    and then proceeds with ffmpeg. I installed  (which the Arch Linux AUR page says is necessary for hlsnative) but this didnt seem to do anything. youtube-dl always wants to use ffmpeg for extraction.  Whats missing to get hlsnative to work in Ubuntu?

I am however wondering whether it picks the proper knee point. kneed was installed using conda  showing below version   Im running the following code:  If you look at the resulting plots below  I would expect the knee point to be more to the left  basically where you see the max of the difference curve (around 0.3 on the normalized plot in my case). At least thats my understanding of the kneedle algorithm... I tried with different values of S (smaller and bigger)  but cant see any changes here. BTW  Sensitivity is a bit counter intuitive  the smaller S the more coarse the algorithm  maybe its an idea to put it in the denominator of the formula and/or rename it.

302722842,"Error during package installation (maximum recursion depth exceeded )","
Hi   Im submitting a...   - [x] bug report   - [ ] feature request   ## Current Behavior   On a fresh conda installation  when creating a conda environment with large packages like mkl-2018.0.1    which is a dependancy requirement for Numpy  the download of some packages stops quickly  and conda fails with maximum recursion depth exceeded errors.  Notes: - I am behind an entreprise proxy (for which I dont have much info). But I was using conda since one year without any troubles on that same environment. I discovered the problem around Week 8. I was able to reproduce the problem on other servers behind the same proxy  or on a different proxy (for which I dont details neither)  - there is no issue to donwload stuff from internet from that server. I can manually download the faulty packages from https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/main/linux-64/ repository with curl or wget whithout any troubles. But that fails with conda for certain packages - this seems to concern large packages. The problem now occurs systematically with mkl-2018.0.1 - If the packages to install are already in the local cache  the problem might not be visible - Currently I am testing with latest version of conda package and latest  version of Miniconda3 installer.  But I have tested also with older versions that proved to be working before for me. Same error.  I wonder if this could be similar/related to https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/5032 ?   ### Steps to Reproduce    Here are the logs with no debug   Here are selected logs running the same command but with the  flags :     ## Expected Behavior   The packages download should not fails with conda (troncated bzip2 archive in local cache)   ## Environment Information             ",14222416,"[(56765518, 0.9095039), (31878423, 0.88747966), (53979084, 0.88070256), (52672463, 0.87736076), (58223612, 0.8743643), (56779905, 0.8702796), (51846274, 0.8692247), (43398961, 0.8685496), (49932759, 0.8677524), (57517596, 0.86766946)] "

402549468,"Multiple noarch feedstocks fail to autotick","cf-regro-autotick-bot appears to have arthritically fallen down and can no longer get it up   at least  with respect to the two principal feedstocks I maintain: BETSE and BETSEE.  BETSE 0.9.2 and BETSEE 0.9.2.0 were both released over twenty-four hours ago but have yet to receive any automated loving from my formerly favourite autoticker. In the halcyon days of yore  the autoticker would respond within an hour (typically  minutes) of a PyPI release. I can only assume that conda-forge automation loathes scientific simulators  presumably in a futile attempt to forestall the inevitable Machine Singularity. :robot:   ## Here Is Where I Sigh Forlornly  Of course  Life could be worse. Since manually bumping feedstocks is trivial (if needlessly time-consuming)  this isnt necessarily the highest priority ticket. Since another feestock also appears to now be ignored by cf-regro-autotick-bot  however  this may be a slightly more widespread issue. (In which case  this might be a high priority ticket after all.)  Unlike said feedstock  there are no nomenclature complications in the case of either BETSE or BETSEE. Their PyPI project names are the same as their conda-forge feedstock names. Likewise  there have been no significant changes to either their  recipes or their  installation scripts. Both comply with  syntax and semantics  including usage of the now-favoured  list of mandatory dependencies. Moreover  both are tagged as  and thus quite minimal.  Unfortunately  Im under contractual deadlines here. Ill probably need to manually bump both feedstocks before anything resembling a fleshy human gets a chance to examine these issues. I suspect that may complicate debugging on your end.  ## Throw Us a Friggin Bone Here  O.K.  I have only one unfounded suspicion as to the underlying culprit. To circumvent conda/conda-build#3318  @jjhelmus kindly injected the  option into the  command for both feedstocks.  Thats it  guys. Thats all Ive got. Admittedly  its not much. Would someone on the bot sub-team mind examining the autoticker logs for any suspicious exceptions  warnings  or other incriminating evidence?  I dearly loved the cf-regro-autotick-bot for the copious free time it once granted me. Admittedly  I squandered it all playing fanservice-friendly JRPGs. Persona 5. Always Persona 5.

So  one possible (easy  though weird) way could be to invoke the whole process as  ssh localhost  _  and do a module purge before letting the _environ.pkg kick in. 2. Log the package tar-gzip ball too and possibly the tar gzip of the whole build dir. One of us should be able to rebuild without having to download. 3.

Plot it. 4) You will find that the perigee happens for a point very nearly to the equator (OK because right ascension of ascending node is  and the argument of perigee is also ).  NOT OK case: 1) Take the following TLE (only differs in eccentricity from the former  now is )  2) Repeat step 2 from OK case. 2) Repeat step 3 from OK case. 3) For me  perigee is not a point very nearly to the equator! (not OK  given that right ascension of ascending node is  and the argument of perigee is also  then the perigee should a point very near to the equator).

450065277,"Possible memory leak bug with `to_sql` with chunksize ? ","Code Sample  a copy-pastable example if possible   #### Problem description  I created a large database in Pandas  about 6 million rows of text data. I wanted to save this as a SQL database file  but when I try to save it  I get an out of memory RAM error. I even reduced the chuck size to 100 and it still crashes.   However  if I just have smaller version of that dataframe with 100 000 rows  and save it to a database with no chucksize specified  I have no issues saving tha dataframe.   My understanding was that since its only processing 100 rows at a time  the RAM usage should reflect that of a save of 100 rows. Is there something else happening behind the scenes? Perhaps multi-threading?  Before I run this code  I am using 4.8 GB RAM  out of the 12.8 GB RAM available in Google Colab. Running the above code eats up all the RAM until the enviroment crashes.   I would like to be able to save my pandas dataframe to a SQL file without my environment crashing. The environment I am in is Google Colab. The pandas datafame is 2 columns  ~6 million rows. Each cell contains about this much text:  > The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex > recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder > configuration.

When I install them with pip  they have a size of 159.7 MiB and 69.1 MiB (for the same versions  of course).  I can go down to something like 114.1 MiB for scipy if I install it like this:   I observe the same kind of difference for PIL or other libraries (they are big enough for the difference to be significant).  This wouldnt normally bother me much  but Im bundling some of my programs  with all the libraries embedded  and the size of the final executable is much bigger.  Can someone explain to me why I observe such a difference ? Is it due to the recent switch to wheel ?  I also tried to strip the libraries  which seems to give much more reasonable file sizes  but it doesnt always work. It doesnt work on numpy for example.

What I have observed so far can be summarized by the following test performed on an HPC cluster with SLURM scheduler. If I run my script serially on 1 proc  I get an execution time of neighbour search of 0.00285557 sec. This number is an average over 96 repetitions  that is  in my script the first and only process loops over the same search 96 times. If I run my script in parallel on 96 procs (I use mpi4py)  I get an execution time of neighbour search of 0.212207 sec. This time  every process executes only once the neighbour search. In total  I have 96 such numbers  which average to ~0.2.  I tried to find a reason for this 100-fold difference  but I cannot really understand it. Why a single call of SpatialHashNNPS requires ~0.002 sec if I run serially  but ~0.2 sec if I run in parallel. Shouldnt the time for a single call be mostly independent from the number of processors I use? The only thing that might explain this is that SpatialHashNNPS is parallelized and therefore dependent on the number of processors. Is it so?

My idea is roughly this:  - Move  to be a member of   - Add a plugin hook that gets to customize the computed MRO.  @JukkaL  does this sound like a feature you would take?   Example of needing to customize the MRO:  - My metaclass  injects a implementation-detail base  into each class it creates. s semantics demand that  be at the very end of the MRO (to allow overloading of its features).  - Let us define  and .  - Each class injects its own base:  and . That means that  actually has both implementation-detail bases.  - Unfortunately   and  conflict  and  ends up after  in the MRO  which is the opposite of what you want (child must overload parent  not vice versa).   - At runtime   can simply remove the -produced base from s MRO  and all is well.  - In current   removing  from s MRO seems impossible.

I have prepared the file lists  plugged in your weights  froze the first layers until the bottleneck in the code  and tried to run  . However  for some reason I do get an annoying error prior to training  that is likely related to the fact youre using multiprocessing to speed up data generation:    I also tried to set the number of processes to 1  and that did not help either.

I believe updating to a different version of gcc (w/openmp) should do the trick  but unfortunately I cant figure out how to update setup.py to use a different version of gcc (maybe just change environment variables via os.environ?).  Also  we should think through what this means for our Mac customer base.

I have a question regarding fanart for music. But I m not sure whether this is a problem of PKC or not.  > I have a huge library of Soundtracks in Plex. Each artist has a poster and a background (showing the artist). And also each album has a poster (front cover) and a background (movie wallpaper). All are synced via PKC to Kodi (Intel NUC with LibreELEC). When I m browsing through the list of artists  each artist is visualised and the belonging background is shown when the artist is highlighted. After selecting an artist the associated albums are shown and when I browse through the list of albums  all belonging backgrounds (movie wallpaper) are displayed.  > And now comes the strange thing: when I select an album and the track list is shown  for some albums the belonging movie wallpaper is visible (as expected)  but for tracks of other albums the artist background or a random background is shown. It seems that these tracks are incident with the artist background and not with the album background. After further investigations I m pretty sure that all albums are affected of all artists with a beginning letter from A to J.  > I have another Kodi/PKC player on my windows pc and all albums are affected there.  > This behavior occurs with different skins. So my thought was that maybe the way how PKC syncs can be the problem. Or do I miss something?

422225061,"Poor performance when opening raw data with (wrong) gzip encoding in header","Manually putting a field encoding=raw in the header overrides any compression_level>0 input to nrrd.write()  which I guess is the way it was intended to be. And when setting encoding=gzip and writing a file with compression_level=0  the output is uncompressed but the header is unmodified. This would not be an issue if it wasnt for the fact that reading a raw data file with encoding=gzip in the header (which it should not have of course) seems to take much longer.  In my example with a 600MB raw data  writing with compression_level=0 and encoding=raw in the header gives one 600MB file  and writing again  just changing to encoding=gzip in the header  gives another 600MB file. However  reading the latter with nrrd.read() takes 300(!) times longer than reading the first.  There is probably and explanation if you look into the details  but it feels like if compression_level=0  the encoding should be set to raw in the header automatically on write?",12169839,"[(39151276, 0.8577007), (36666490, 0.8568876), (57452548, 0.85018575), (17056382, 0.84658027), (48053207, 0.8452219), (57105535, 0.84480655), (56530892, 0.84450454), (22915295, 0.8417521), (39924518, 0.8413308), (57154550, 0.84130824)] "
384139904,"Ideas for improvement - Winter 2019","Some thoughts on improving algorithm performance.  1. Currently there is some evidence of search stalling. My approach is usually to run more random seeds  a larger population size  larger number of parent solutions (lower search pressure)  or a lower crossover probability (because 1-cx_prob will replace with randomly generated trees).  Idea from @quaquel : Bring some of the tricks from e-NSGAII to policy trees to counteract stalled search: auto-adaptive population sizing and restarts.  2.

224904626,"Worker shutdown creates duplicate messages in SQS broker","Checklist  Im  installing Celery from .  ## Steps to reproduce  Submit a task to an SQS broker and verify that there are 1 messages available and 0 messages in flight (total messages: 1). Launch a worker connected to that broker and now verify that there are 0 messages available and 1 messages in flight (total messages: 1). Shutdown the worker before the task completes (via Ctrl + C). The task will then be resubmitted with the following message:    Verify that the total number of messages in SQS is now 2 (1 available and 1 in flight).  Repeat.  ## Expected behavior  I expect the total number of messages in the SQS broker to remain constant  as is the behavior I observe when I perform the repro with a Redis broker.  ## Actual behavior  Messages are duplicated  which can cause the queue to grow in an unbounded way.

This seems to be a massive hole because if you are not expecting data with a request and so dont read anything then that data is left in the input stream (assuming ) and so forms the start of the next request.  In fact I have even tried sending a request with another request in the data and Flask processes that data as if it were the next request and sends that in response to the following request.  I have resolved this issue by copying the body of the  clause in the  function inside  from  in pallets/werkzeug and having this new function decorated with .  This ensures that the input stream is always drained after every request and so left over data is not mis-interpreted as the start of the next request.  Anyway  if I am expected to handle this situation manually as I have done can something be added to the documentation (or if its already there can you point it out to me  somehow I couldnt find it).

Run the following simple code snippet:  import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  x = np.arange(10) y = np.array([1.9  3.3  5  6.3  8  6  2  3  2.5  4])  fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(111) ax.plot(x  y  -o label=label) ax.set_xlabel(DOY) ax.set_ylabel(flux) ax.set_title(Photosynthesis rates) ax.legend() ax.grid() plt.show() What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I get a grey or blank figure screen instead of the figure itself (see attachement matplotlib-blank screen). Only after applying an action  eg zooming  the figure becomes visible (see attachement matplotlib-after action). After closing the figure  I also have a problem with the console: it just stays blank (no marks >>>)  but it does not hang (you can type in it etc).  In general  my impression is also that matplotlib is running very slow within spyder (I dont have the problem with matplotlib in python from the terminal). What version of the product are you using?

To solve this problem I got the idea that this may be done in two steps: 1. Add a new column whose values at each cell is a python list of the values the new column takes on. 2. Unlistify the column thereby creating a new row for each element in the above lists.  I.e. I propose two new DataFrame methods  listify() and unlistify().  : Takes as input a dataframe and the name of a column. It will do a groupby of the df for all columns except column and generate a single row where the values in the column cell is a list of the column  values.  : Takes as input a dataframe and the name of a column. It will iterate over the values of the contents of  for each row and generate a new row for each value.  The functions may be expanded to support multiple columns.  may e.g. support a post processing function  that will be applied on the list.  The following python code illustrates these two functions.

The CMD window is NOT froze  it just sits there and does nothing. I can try this with the 3.6 python as well  and it does the same thing: call python3.6 -m pip freeze --local | grep -v -e | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip install -U Ive tried powershell as well and it does the same thing.

175843901,"Discussion: Ideas for optimizing loading > Cache Objects","Background  Load time  even with verbose off is long consider some people like me restart revit several times a day. Those seconds add-up. A few people I have shared pyrevit with have mentioned this. Ideally  loading the scripts should be as seamless as other addins. ### Proposal:  Besides continuing to update loading methods (reading files only once  and improving code perfomancem  etc) I would like to propose the idea of creating a cache. In most reboots  contents of pyrevit folder remain unchanged  so results of the processing the folders could be cached. If they are unchanged  cached is loaded into memory and ribbon is rebuilt without needing to re scan directories  find doc strings  process icon file names  etc. ### Implementation  After processing paths  files  icons  doc  version etc all the objects are pickled/serialized and dumped into a cache folder and stored with with some sort of hash to identify the specific contents. Next time revit starts  it first checks if hash derived from new files match the pickled file. if it has not changed  it  just reload those objects into memory without having to reprocess file tree. ##### Hash  could be generated from folder sizes  mod date  or perhaps just ziping the entire folder  and computing a md5 hash from the zip file (probably the most effective and efficient if folder file size is small).

117676647,Diagnostics,"Motivation  When optimizing complex problems on  I run into performance issues that seem unintuitive. In these cases it would be valuable to have more visibility into the functioning of the network both at the per-worker level and at the communication level.    A snappy visualization here would be valuable both for performance tuning and  if it is sufficiently flashy  then also for demonstration purposes. ### Some things I would like to know per worker 1.  What is the CPU utilization? 2.  What is the RAM use? 3.  What kinds of tasks are running? (similar to the coloring used in the dask Profiler) 4.  How much time is spent communicating and serializing/deserializing? ### Information about inter-node communication 1.  How much communication is there between workers?   2.  Which workers seem to be innudated? 3.  Which data elements are moving around the most? (again coloring similar to what is used in the dask Profiler) ### Visual Design  What is the right way to present this information to a user?  What information should be immediately visible and what other information should require some kind of interaction  either with links  hover tool-tips  etc..  It would be nice to dogfood bokeh here. ### Possible approaches  Its on me to collect this data (this is not hard) but Im not sure what the right thing is to do with it after or during collection.  We could approach this in at least the following ways: 1.  We could have the workers record and send logs to a central point.  We could analyze these in bulk after a large set of computations. 2.  We could use existing socket mechanisms already within  to send a stream of information real time to some diagnostic process. 3.  We could have each of the workers use the web functionality of tornado to serve their diagnostic information as web endpoints.  A client application could poll from these periodically (can bokeh handle this?)  This is of moderately high priority for  development.  My hope is that @jcrist can work on this (he worked on the diagnostics for dask) but it would also be nice to get some input from some Bokeh or web developers as well  perhaps @bryevdv can recommend a good contact person to work with on this (if anyone is available.)",938733,"[(58665473, 0.9061068), (16040039, 0.8996792), (6998320, 0.8881757), (27842069, 0.8789324), (55311399, 0.8753333), (3420594, 0.8745284), (57126286, 0.8735), (24791113, 0.8731847), (58534959, 0.87257755), (35520160, 0.8722128)] "

We want to allow each region to provide one or more Open311 endpoints that are used within its region where OBA should submit problem reports to.  More than one Open311 endpoint per region is ok as long as the geographic bounds of each Open311 system do NOT overlap.  To accomplish this  we plan to add two fields to the OBA Server Directory: -  - A pipe () separated list of Open311 endpoints in the region.  The order should match  order. -  - A pipe () separated list of API keys used to access Open311 endpoints in the region.  The order should match  order.

417548368,"Astropy modeling memory leak -- problem with models with large arrays","In astropy versions > 1  the modeling framework appears to deep copy models when they are concatenated. In version 1  I think it uses a reference. This makes a very big difference when the models contain very large arrays. Im using a spectral fitting library which contains a large grid as part of the model (https://github.com/starkit/starkit). We use the astropy modeling framework to concatenate multiple operations on the spectrum before fitting such as rotation and radial velocity shifts. This requires concatenating multiple operations onto the original model. These operations now take a very long time because the grid gets copied for every operation (I think). Previously  it was basically instantaneous.   The bigger problem is that when fitting multiple spectra  and re-creating the model  the memory is not released so my computer quickly runs out of ram. Even using the del command does not release the memory on the variable.   Im not sure how to deal with this issue. Right now  we are unable to use any astropy version past 1. Is there a way to not deepcopy the models?

With the following code:    I can get:    We could still keep the option to override this in other packages if we want  but at least this should make it so that in practice it should never be needed - and we could actually remove it from the package template and just document how to do it in the package-template docs since it should be rare.
